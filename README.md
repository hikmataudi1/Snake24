# Snake24

## Description
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a fun and interactive web-based version of the traditional Snake game where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. The game features smooth animations, responsive controls, and a high score tracking system to keep players engaged.

## Features
- **Responsive Controls**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows longer with each piece of food it eats, increasing the game's difficulty.
- **High Score Tracking**: Keep track of your highest score and challenge yourself to beat it.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game detects collisions with the walls and the snake's own body, ending the game when such collisions occur.
- **Canvas Rendering**: Utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API to render the game graphics for smooth and efficient performance.
- **Stylish Design**: A simple yet visually appealing design to provide an enjoyable gaming experience.
- **A Surprise**: Well, I encourage you to try it yourself!
